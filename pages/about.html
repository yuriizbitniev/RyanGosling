<h3>Early life and education</h3>
<p>
    Ryan Thomas Gosling was born on November 12, 1980, at St. Joseph's Hospital in London, Ontario, the son of Thomas
    Ray
    Gosling, a traveling salesman for a paper mill, and Donna, a secretary. Both of his parents are of part French
    Canadian descent, along with some German, English, Scottish, and Irish. He and his family were members of The Church
    of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and Gosling has said that the religion influenced every aspect of their lives.
    Because of his father's work, they "moved around a lot" and Gosling lived in both Cornwall, Ontario and Burlington,
    Ontario. His parents divorced when he was 13, and he and his older sister Mandi lived with their mother, an
    experience Gosling has credited with programming him "to think like a girl".
<p>
    Gosling was educated at Gladstone Public School, Cornwall Collegiate and Vocational School and Lester B. Pearson
    High
    School. As a child, he watched Dick Tracy and was inspired to become an actor. He "hated" being a child, was bullied
    in elementary school, and had no friends until he was "14 or 15". In grade one, having been heavily influenced by
    the action film First Blood, he took steak knives to school and threw them at other children during recess. This
    incident led to a suspension. He was unable to read,and was evaluated for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
    (ADHD), but was not diagnosed with it and, contrary to false reports, never took medication.] His mother left her
    job and home-schooled him for a year. He has said homeschooling gave him "a sense of autonomy that I've never really
    lost". Gosling performed in front of audiences from an early age, encouraged by his sister being a performer. He and
    his sister sang together at weddings; he performed with Elvis Perry, his uncle's Elvis Presley tribute act, and was
    involved with a local ballet company. Performing boosted his self-confidence as it was the only thing for which he
    received praise. He developed an idiosyncratic accent because, as a child, he thought having a Canadian accent did
    not sound "tough". He began to model his accent on that of Marlon Brando. He dropped out of high school at age
    seventeen to focus on his acting career.</p>
<h3>Acting career</h3>
<p>
    In 2015, Gosling played a bond salesman in the ensemble financial satire The Big Short, a Best Picture nominee at
    the
    2016 Academy Awards. David Sims of The Atlantic felt that he was "smarmily funny, somehow simultaneously magnetic
    and repulsive; after years wandering the halls of mediocre art cinema, it's wonderful to see him cut loose
    again." Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said: "Gosling, a virtuoso of verbal sleaze, talks directly to the
    camera, and he's volcanically fierce and funny." The following year, Gosling starred in the black comedy The
    Nice Guys, opposite Russell Crowe, and in Damien Chazelle's musical La La Land, for which he won the Golden
    Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and received his second Academy Award for Best Actor
    nomination. Robbie Collin praised his chemistry with co-star Emma Stone, writing: "Both stars are so attuned to
    each other's pace and flow that their repartee just seems to tumble out, perfectly formed." It emerged as one
    of his most commercially successful films, with earnings of over $440 million against its $30 million budget.
<p>
    Gosling was signed on to work with Terrence Malick in 2004 on the biographical film Che, but later dropped
    out. He made an appearance in Malick's Song to Song (2017), which co-starred Christian Bale and Cate
    Blanchett. Also in 2017, he starred in Blade Runner 2049, a sequel to the 1982 science fiction film Blade
    Runner, directed by Denis Villeneuve and co-starring Harrison Ford, who reprised his role as Rick Deckard. Gosling's
    role was as Officer K, a "blade runner" working for the LAPD whose job it is to kill rogue bioengineered humans
    known as replicants. A. O. Scott found him to be perfectly cast, adding that his "ability to elicit sympathy
    while seeming too distracted to want it – his knack for making boredom look like passion and vice versa – makes him
    a perfect warm-blooded robot for our time".[165] Despite being Gosling's largest box office opening, grossing $31.5
    million domestically, the film generally underperformed at the box office.
<p>
    In 2018, Gosling portrayed Neil Armstrong, the astronaut who became the first man to walk on the Moon in 1969, in
    Chazelle's biopic First Man, based on the book First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong.[167] Writing for IndieWire,
    Michael Nordine commended him for bringing "quiet charisma" and "grace" to his role, while Nicholas Barber of the
    BBC hailed him as the "best deadpan actor in the business".[168][169]</p>
<h3>Personal life</h3>
<p>
    Gosling previously resided in New York City with his mixed-breed dog George. He co-owns Tagine, a Moroccan
    restaurant in Beverly Hills, California. He bought the restaurant on an impulse; he has said that he spent "all
    [his] money" on it, spent a year doing the renovation work himself, and now oversees the restaurant's menus.
<p>
    Gosling dated his Murder by Numbers co-star Sandra Bullock from 2002 to 2003. He then had a relationship with
    his The Notebook co-star Rachel McAdams from 2005 to 2007, before they briefly reunited in 2008.
<p>
    Gosling has been in a relationship with his The Place Beyond the Pines co-star Eva Mendes since September 2011.
    The couple have two daughters, one born in 2014 and the second in 2016.
<p>
    Gosling is supportive of various social causes. He has worked with PETA on a campaign to encourage KFC and
    McDonald's to use improved methods of chicken slaughter in their factories, and on a campaign encouraging dairy
    farmers to stop de-horning cows. Gosling volunteered in Biloxi, Mississippi in 2005, as part of the
    clean-up effort following Hurricane Katrina.] He is a supporter of Invisible Children, Inc., a group that raises
    awareness about the LRA in Central Africa. In 2005, Gosling traveled to Darfur refugee camps in Chad.
    He was a speaker at Campus Progress' National Conference in 2008 where he discussed Darfur. As part of his work
    with the Enough Project, he visited Uganda in 2007[210] and eastern Congo in 2010.
<p>
    During the filming for Barbie, Gosling was seen wearing a fan made t-shirt of his co-star Ncuti Gatwa as the
    Fourteenth Doctor from Doctor Who to show his support for their casting. He has previously expressed admiration
    for actor Matt Smith, who played the Eleventh Doctor, which led him to cast the actor for his film Lost
    River.</p>
